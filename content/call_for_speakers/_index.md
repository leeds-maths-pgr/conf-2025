**Put them in their place with a brilliant talk/poster for your research area!**

We highly encourage you to contribute a talk and/or a poster, no matter which group or stage-of-study you are in.
Talks will be very short (~20 minutes), and you will have the opportunity to summarise your research area to people who would never otherwise give it a moment's thought.

**Please sign up to contribute a talk and/or a poster by filling out [this poll](https://forms.office.com/e/JkULn3n5vL).**
